# Malware-Detection-Base-Learners-Dynamic-Voting

The objective of this project is to create an advanced system for precisely classifying URLs linked to websites and APIs, labeling them as phishing, benign, defacement, or malware. The project emphasizes the use of various machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes. It also delves into inventive ensemble approaches such as Majority Voting with Soft Voting and Weighted Voting. The primary aim is to boost detection accuracy and dependability by extensively comparing individual models and ensemble methods. This contribution to cybersecurity aims to establish a strong defense against evolving digital risks
